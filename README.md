A C++ library for: Dimension reductiOn and LookuPs on a Hypercube for effIcient Near Neighbor.

Part of the Data Science Master Thesis of George Samaras, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, 2016.

* src/main.cpp contains a representative example. In general, a data-structure of class Hypercube should be constructed and then one can execute Near (radius) or Nearest Neighbor queries on that Hypercube.
